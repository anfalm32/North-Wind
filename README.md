## 2. üóÇÔ∏è **Northwind Dataset Overview**  
The Northwind dataset represents a fictional business's operations, including sales, shipping, and employee management.  
- **Orders**: Contains details of all transactions.  
- **Customers**: Lists customer information.  
- **Products**: Includes product details such as name and price.  
- **Employees**: Stores information about employees managing orders.  
- **Shippers**: Provides data on shipping companies.  

üí° *The dataset‚Äôs structured relationships allow for multi-dimensional analysis.*

## 3. üõ†Ô∏è **Data Exploration & Transformation with SQL**  
SQL queries were used to extract and transform data from the Northwind database, focusing on key business metrics:  

### **Query 1: Product Revenue Analysis**  
**Purpose**: Calculate total revenue generated by each product and rank products by revenue. 
```sql
SELECT 
    p.ProductName,
    SUM(od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM 
    Products p
JOIN 
    [Order Details] od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY 
    p.ProductName
ORDER BY 
    TotalRevenue DESC;
```
- **Insight**: Highlights top-performing products to focus marketing efforts.  

### **Query 2: Customer Spending Analysis**  
**Purpose**: Summarize total spending per customer and rank them by contribution.
```sql
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CompanyName,
    SUM(od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice) AS TotalSpent
FROM 
    Customers c
JOIN 
    Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN 
    [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od
```
- **Insight**: Identifies high-value customers for targeted marketing campaigns.  

### **Query 3: Employee Performance Analysis**  
**Purpose**: Analyze the number of orders handled and total sales per employee.
```sql
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS EmployeeName,
    COUNT(o.OrderID) AS TotalOrders
FROM 
    Employees e
JOIN 
    Orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
GROUP BY 
    e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
ORDER BY 
    TotalOrders DESC;
```
- **Insight**: Recognizes top-performing employees and allocates resources effectively.  

### **Query 4: Shipping Performance Analysis**  
**Purpose**: Calculate shipping costs and average shipping times by country and carrier.
```sql
SELECT 
    s.ShipperName,
    c.Country,
    AVG(o.Freight) AS AvgFreight,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, o.OrderDate, o.ShippedDate) AS AvgShippingTime
FROM 
    Shippers s
JOIN 
    Orders o ON s.ShipperID = o.ShipVia
JOIN 
    Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
WHERE 
    o.ShippedDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    s.ShipperName, c.Country
ORDER BY 
    AvgShippingTime;
```
- **Insight**: Improves shipping efficiency and cost management.  

### **Query 5: Order Delivery Status Analysis**  
**Purpose**: Categorize orders as ‚ÄúOn Time,‚Äù ‚ÄúLate,‚Äù or ‚ÄúCancelled.‚Äù
```sql
SELECT 
    o.OrderID,
    CASE 
        WHEN o.ShippedDate IS NULL THEN 'Cancelled'
        WHEN o.ShippedDate > o.RequiredDate THEN 'Late'
        ELSE 'On Time'
    END AS DeliveryStatus
FROM 
    Orders o;
```
- **Insight**: Evaluates logistics and delivery performance.

## 4. üßπ **Data Cleaning**  
Data was cleaned using Power Query and SQL:  
- Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., fax numbers and postal codes).  
- Handled null values for missing yet meaningful data.  
- Streamlined datasets for performance optimization in Power BI.  

---

## 5. üìä **Data Modeling**  
Relationships between tables were established in Power BI:  
- Primary keys and foreign keys were mapped for data integrity.  
- Adjustments were made for compatibility issues during modeling.  

---

## 6. üîç **Data Analysis & Insights**  
Key findings include:  
- **Top Revenue-Generating Products**: Focus on high-performing products.  
- **High-Value Customers**: Target personalized campaigns.  
- **Employee Productivity**: Align workload with performance metrics.  
- **Shipping Costs**: Identify and prioritize cost-effective shippers.  

---

## 7. üìà **Dashboard Overview**  
The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key business metrics, including:  
- **Revenue by Product**: Visualizes top products by sales.  
- **Customer Trends**: Identifies high-value customer segments.  
- **Employee Contributions**: Tracks orders handled and sales achieved.  
- **Shipping Efficiency**: Compares average costs and times by carrier.  

Interactive filters allow users to explore data by:  
- Time periods (Year/Quarter/Month).  
- Products and Categories.  
- Countries and Cities.  

---

## 8. üöß **Challenges Faced**  
- Complex relationships between tables required careful modeling.
